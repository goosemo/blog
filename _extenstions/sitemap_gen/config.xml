  sitemap_gen.py example configuration script

  This file specifies a set of sample input parameters for the
  sitemap_gen.py client.

  You should copy this file into "config.xml" and modify it for
  your server.

<!-- ** MODIFY **
  The "site" node describes your basic web site.

  Required attributes:
    base_url   - the top-level URL of the site being mapped
    store_into - the webserver path to the desired output file.
                 This should end in '.xml' or '.xml.gz'
                 (the script will create this file)

  Optional attributes:
    verbose    - an integer from 0 (quiet) to 3 (noisy) for
                 how much diagnostic output the script gives
    suppress_search_engine_notify="1"
               - disables notifying search engines about the new map
                 (same as the "testing" command-line argument.)
    default_encoding
               - names a character encoding to use for URLs and
                 file paths.  (Example: "UTF-8")

          FILTERS

  Filters specify wild-card patterns that the script compares
  against all URLs it finds.  Filters can be used to exclude
  certain URLs from your Sitemap, for instance if you have
  hidden content that you hope the search engines don't find.

  Filters can be either type="wildcard", which means standard
  path wildcards (* and ?) are used to compare against URLs,
  or type="regexp", which means regular expressions are used
  to compare.

  Filters are applied in the order specified in this file.

  An action="drop" filter causes exclusion of matching URLs.
  An action="pass" filter causes inclusion of matching URLs,
  shortcutting any other later filters that might also match.
  If no filter at all matches a URL, the URL will be included.
  Together you can build up fairly complex rules.

  The default action is "drop".
  The default type is "wildcard".

  You can MODIFY or DELETE these entries as appropriate for
  your site.  However, unlike above, the example entries in
  this section are not contrived and may be useful to you as
  they are.

  <!-- Exclude URLs that end with a '~'   (IE: emacs backup files)      -->
