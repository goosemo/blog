title: Authenticating Redmine from existing Wordpress users table

Why would you want to
=====================

When I first setup the site for the `game creation club`_ at osu, it was
decided to use wordpress_ for the blogging software. We only needed a place to
put up content and have it world readable. This worked great, and when we later
needed a forum for the club, the makers of Wordpress_ already had bbPress_
going and it boasted a nice interegration with the existing user table.


Then came more
===============

Members of the club were starting to make projects and write code. Which is
great, and since I'd just been introducted to version control a bit earlier in
the year, I decided to have people colaborate with SVN_. I also dabbled with
using Trac_ for some of the project management. 

On those additions I wrote about how to `auth trac and svn`_ using a phpass
plugin for apache. Which allowed those two to use the same user tables simply
for all user auths. That also was nice since, people using the system had a
nice interface for updating passwords for these tools already, and knew how to
use it by then as well.


Now to add Redmine_
====================

Being that the club_ is one that has a number of programming projects at any
one time, a manager system with tickets would be an ideal addition. I'm also
now pretty familiar with Redmine_ because of the Fabric_ project, which uses it
at the moment.

Redmine_'s install was simple enough, follwing directions got it up and running
pretty quickly. Did have to used thin to run it, as passenger wasn't liking me
running it in directory, that and I don't have subdomain rights for the club's
domain root (as that's osu.edu).


Authentication
===============

The Redmine_ app comes with builtin user tables and auth, which would be great
if I needed that. It also comes with the option to use LDAP to auth users, so
one can have a preexisting user list to auth from, but I don't use LDAP. So
really beyond that, there isn't any plugin (that works well) that I can use.

There are a number of plugins and scripts to actually get apache to auth from
the Remine_ tables, which would have been nice too if I'd started with it for
the site. But the blog came first, and all other apps later.


The way to circumvent this issue
=================================

Why hack your own auth for Redmine_ of course! I am not a Ruby_ pro



# Compare input and stored hash
known = '$P$9IQRaTwmfeRo7ud9Fh4E2PdI0S3r.L0'
p phpass.check('test12345', known) # => true
p phpass.check('test12346', known) # => false
