Mutt is wonderful
-----------------

If you've not yet heard or of mutt_ or seen it in action, I would suggest going
out and looking it up now. It was the first in a line of many cli apps that I
now use daily. I can't really get used to another way to work with my mail
anymore. A brief reprieve due to moving places recently forced me to use gmail
only and it wan't anywhere near as simple.
