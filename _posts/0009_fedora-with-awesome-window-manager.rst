title: Fedora with awesome window manager
---
I have recently gotten into tiling window managers. Awesome being the one I've found I like to use the most. There are others and they all have their merits, I just settled on this one, and then got comfortable. I also am a bit of a mutt in what distro's I use. Work they put ubuntu on my box, home I have usually used fedora but now it's fedora on the desktop and arch on the laptop.

So the issue was arch and ubuntu both had awesome in the package repos, and fedora did not. There is discussion out there as to why this was, and you might be interested in it. Me, I just wanted to use awesome. So using the directions from the awesome wiki and grabbing the required source rpms cairo-1.8.8-3.fc12.src.rpm and awesome-3.4.4-1.fc12.src.rpm, I now have awesome on my desktop.

**Here are some of the docs and sources I used:**

	* `directions from awesome's wiki <http://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/Awesome-3-fedora>`_
	* `awesome src.rpms for fedora <http://mnowak.fedorapeople.org/awesome/>`_
	* `the cario src.rpm <http://rpm.pbone.net/index.php3/stat/26/dist/69/size/6660576/name/cairo-1.8.8-3.fc12.src.rpm>`_
	* `discussion on package inclusion <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=452427>`_
