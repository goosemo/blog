The other day, I gave a presentation to the Ohio State University, Open Source Club. It was on a smattering of command line utilities that I use on a daily basis, as well as a quick intro to regex usage.

It is all accessible on my site here_ and in pdf_ form.

It was pretty long, and presenting it took a little over an hour. I plan on distilling the parts I liked talking about into more concise presentations, and also a blog post or two.

Awk and find will most likely be their own posts/presentations. I think I need to learn some more of the advanced uses of sed, and revisit that section to make it a bit more clear.
